# Chatbot-using-RNN  
## 1 Overview  
 In this project, we aim to implement a chatbot capable of answering questions based on
 a given ”story.” The foundation for our work is the BaBi dataset, a resource released by
 Facebook Research, which provides a set of tasks designed to evaluate the reasoning abilities
 of machine learning models.
 
 ### 1.1 Problem Statement
 The primary objective is to develop a chatbot that can comprehend and respond to questions
 related to a provided narrative. The BaBi dataset consists of various tasks, each formulated
 as a ”story” followed by associated questions. Our challenge is to train a model that can
 effectively understand these stories and generate accurate responses to the corresponding
 queries.
 
 ### 1.2 Dataset- BaBi

 The BaBi dataset serves as the cornerstone of our project. It contains a diverse set of tasks,
 each designed to evaluate specific aspects of a model’s reasoning abilities. The dataset
 encompasses a range of story types, making it a comprehensive resource for training and
 evaluating our chatbot.
 
 ### 1.3 Methodology
 Our approach involves leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to build a chatbot capable of contextual understanding. We will
 employ techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers to capture the
 sequential nature of the stories and questions.
 
 ### 1.4 Significance
 The successful implementation of this chatbot has potential applications in various domains,
 including customer support, information retrieval, and educational assistance. Improving
 the ability of machines to comprehend and respond to natural language queries is a funda
mental step towards enhancing human-computer interactions.

### 1.5 Scope and Limitations
 While we strive for a robust chatbot, it’s important to acknowledge potential limitations.
 The performance of the model may vary based on the complexity of the stories, and certain
 nuances of language understanding might pose challenges.
 This project represents an exciting exploration into the intersection of natural language
 processing and machine learning, with the ultimate goal of advancing the capabilities of
 conversational AI systems.
